# Main goal

This repository contains the solution for the [Name of the Data Science Competition/Homework/etc] by [Your Name]. The goal of this competition was to [Briefly describe the problem statement].

In this section, provide a brief overview of your solution. Explain the motivation behind your approach and the main challenges you faced during the development process.


# Solution

In this section, provide a brief overview of your solution. Explain the motivation behind your approach and the main challenges you faced during the development process.


Describe the data used in this competition, including the source, the type of data, and any preprocessing steps that were performed.


Explain the methods and algorithms used in your solution. Provide a high-level overview of your workflow, including any key steps or decisions made during the development process.


Present the results of your solution. Include relevant metrics and compare your results to the competition baseline, if available.


# How to

Provide instructions on how to use your solution. This may include steps to clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the code.


## Requirements
Requirements is stored in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt):

    # external requirements
    pandas
    scikit-learn

## Installation

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage example

    python src/train.py
